            <center><h1>MAMA University</h1></center><br>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;MAMA was established in 2010 as a Cambodian university with a United Kingdom curriculum. There were 5 founders who envisioned a new university that would meet international standards and be based on the UK educational system.
                MAMA began operations in December 2010 in a temporary facility in Boeung Keng Kong.  It was grounded on several principles:  senior managers were to be highly qualified, experienced western administrators with administrative skills and experience in academic affairs; faculty must have terminal degrees from U.K. institutions or other european countries, and teaching experience in european institutions; an undergraduate curriculum that meets U.K. accreditation requirements for a balance between liberal arts education and appropriate coursework for a major; and the recruitment of students who aspire to high levels of achievement.

                <br><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A Board of Control (BOC) was formed to direct the course of the University and oversee its development. The Board is composed of British educators, executives of higher education institutions in the U.K., and business executives from Cambodia and around the globe. It is dedicated to making MAMA a leading higher education institution in Cambodia, fostering socially responsible behavior, lifelong learning, academic and professional excellence among students; and to producing students who are critical thinkers, innovators and ethical leaders to serve Cambodia.</p> 
                <br><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;MAMA’s new modern facility was finished in June 2015 and has been designed to enhance and support a model academic teaching and learning environment, incorporating the newest technologies, guided individual learning center and student services that will complement academic offerings.  This environment will allow students to develop their potential and acquire the education necessary and relevant for 21st century competitiveness.</p>
                The students attending MAMA are impressive. They have a strong desire to improve their society and to make a mark on its development.  They are bright; they have a vision and they are the future.  They come from all over Cambodia, with an increasing number from other countries in the region.  MAMA provides scholarships for students based on academic high school performance and financial need.
                <br><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the spring of 2013, MAMA signed agreements for dual degrees with Monash University and with Paragon International University. The  Monash University dual programs are International Relation and Economics.  The dual degrees with Paragon are Business administration and Banking and Finance.</p>
                The history of MAMA is short, the accomplishments are enduring.  This sets MAMA on a trajectory of meeting its vision and being a best University to assist Cambodia in its human resources development.

      <br><h3>Working at MAMA</h3><br>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; MAMA offers a unique working environment with scholars from Cambodia and overseas alike. Our remuneration scheme has attracted many experienced faculty and staff members from the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and various other global regions. Our students’ growth is our main motivation. In 2015, we moved into our new state-of-the-art campus located in the southern Phnom Penh, the robust capital of Cambodia. The city, as well as Cambodia in general, is not only known for its rich history and culture, but also for its friendly people.
        Whether you are a young scholar seeking to build your academic career, a veteran educator looking for ways to contribute, or anything between, MAMA will provide a supportive environment where you can succeed while contributing to the human resources development of Cambodia. Furthermore, MAMA offers a competitive benefits package which includes round-trip airfare (conditions apply), a free visa, free work permit, and a subsidized international healthcare plan.
